1-Tranformation in 3d space:
1- lets say you hav a square with following points [1, 1, 0, 1], [-1, 1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 0, 1], [1, -1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1]

Try to rotate around x then y with angles: 30°, 90°

Do translation into new location with origin: (0, 3,0)

Try to rotate around z by 30 degree, then into a new point (-1, -1, 3)

2-Tranformation in 3d space:
Creating a space craft or simply a cube using math plot that can rotating
moving forward
rotating and moving forward
